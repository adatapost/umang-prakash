<h1>Head One</h1>
<h2>Head Two</h2>
<p>
	font-size: n px | % | em | in | cm | pt;

       px - pixel render text with fixed amount of pixel
            so we should avoid this unit.

       em - equipment mfg unit will scale automatically
            with screen resolution.

       %  - percent is most commonly used measurement. It
            scale height/width of text as we stretch the    

         font scale or change the resolution
       in - inch
       cm - centimeter
       pt - pt is little better measurement then px. The    

         "pt" only scaleup the true-type font's scale.
