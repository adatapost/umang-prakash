PHP Framework & IDE
=================================================

We'll use XAMPP bundle - which is for linux and win os and it includes WebServer, Mail Server, FTP Server and other tools.

You can choose IDE - Integrated Development Environment - NetBeans or Eclipse. We'll use "Eclipse" IDE for PHP, Puby called - Aptana Studio.


[NOTE: PHP and Ruby are languages and their MVC frameworks used by number of industry standard companies including Facebook, Twitter, and many more which uses - PHP Zend Framework, PHP CodeIgnite, Ruby on Rails etc.]


So first of we'll install the XAMPP (which will be installed at c:\xampp folder). Its "control panel" icon allow us to start/stop the various services.


Next to this installation, we'll install the Aptana IDE.


To test the webapp, we'll use latest versions of web-browsers - Mozilla, Chrome, and IE10.


Steps to create webapp manually.
==================================

1. Open XAMPP control panel (double click on icon)
2. Start the "Apache" service

   Apache service will be started on port number "80"
   which is the default port of web-server.

   => Now, open/start the web-browser and type following
      at addressbar

      http://localhost 

      You can see the XAMPP start page + choose your       language (English) and a webapp called 
        http://localhost/xampp will be started.

      the "xampp" is for setting up and viewing the 
       configuration of "web-server", "application-server -        PHP" and so on.

3. Now open the c:\xampp\htdocs folder

   The "htdocs" folder called "Home" of web-server in which
   we can "host" our webapps.

   => create a folder inside the "htdocs" (say -- myapp)

   => open the notepad and save the file by adding .php       extension.

       File Menu + Save As + "index.php" + OK

       NOTE: Put double quotes around  the filename.ext
             so notepad cannot append .txt extension.

       Add some tags in it:

       index.php
       ============
       <!DOCTYPE html>
           <title>My First PHP Page</title>
           <h1>Welcome Home</h1>

4. Open the web-browser at type :

       http://localhost/myapp  
         
          at address-bar,

    The web-server & application server will automatically
    process the "index.php" and sent its output to the     web-browser.

    
    What is Home page?
    ===================
      
    When we request a website/app without specifing a     webpage name then the page which is automatically 
    processed/executed is called "Home" page.

    In PHP, home page name should be "index.php" or
    "index.htm" or "index.html". However you can
    change this settings by editing configuration files.

    [NOTE: We should have to avoid default settings because
           we can change locally installed environment but
           we can't have permission to change the
           environment settings on remote machine.]



PHP Page
========================================================

The PHP page saved with .php (or any extension) and it contains --- Html markup, CSS, JavaScript and PHP code.

To write PHP code into .php file we have four different syntax but we must have to use :

    1. <?php

          ......
       ?>
    2. <?= expression?>

 
 These two syntax are always "enabled" by the PHP environment and they cannot be disabled.



Following syntax are disabled and can be changed via configuration files:

     3.  PHP short tag (it is disabled by default)

        <? 
         .....
         ?>
   
     4. ASP style (it is disabled)

         <%

         %>

 and you can use <script> tag (that is also disabled)
  
         <script language="php">
               ....
         </script>

      Do not use <script> block because we'll use this
      <script> block for JavaScript/jQuery.
