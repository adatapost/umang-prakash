PHP Language
===================================================

> PHP is untype, dynamic server-scripting which offers
  server programming paradigm.

> Following are programming methodlogies that we can work
  on PHP:

   => Object-oriented programming
   => Modular programming
   => Functional programming

   
What is "dynamic" language?

It is the ability of language which allow us to
change the "type" (or datatype) of variable 
during the program execution.

 
  PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, C# are example of
  dynamic languages.


  The "dynamic" variable can store simple data value,
  complex objects and also functions.

What about "functional" programming?

PHP functions are first-class "datatype" and we can
represent functions via "variables" --- This kind of
programming is called "Clousers".


> PHP is case-insensitive programing language. The   keywords, name of class, interface, functions are     case-insensitive.

  Only the ***variables*** in PHP are case-sensitive.

  PHP syntax is derived from C++ because entire PHP
  platform is developed using C++/VC++. However for the
  sake of developers, only the variables in PHP are
  case-sensitive.

  And ofcourse, this "case-insensitive" feature of PHP
  has created a "mess" (Khichdi) around PHP developer   world.

  We must follows the "standard" naming conventions
  for variable name, class name, namespace name, interface
  name and also file names for "smooth" &   "industry standard" developments.

   [We'll strictly follows the coding standard provided by     FIG - Framework InterOp Group - http://php-fig.org

      The FIG is a platform for coding standard running
      by Joomal, Drupal, Zend, CodeIgnite, PHPCake and many
      more industry players.

 Initially we'll use following styles
 =====================================
    
  1. Use "PascalCase" to naming the file, class name,      namespace name and folder names.

     PascalCase ---- Capitalize the first letter of each
                     word.

     e.g

     StudentMarksheet
     PaymentSlip
     
  2. Use "camelCase" to name the variables and      functions/methods. 

     camelCase ---- lowercase the first word and then 
                    capitalize the first letter of each
                    word.

      e.g

       $rollNo = 10;
       $firstName = "Rajesh";

       function getFirstName(){
               ......
       }

       function printTheSheet(){

       }

   
   3. Literals or constants must be written in UPPERCASE.


PHP variables
==============

PHP variables are case-sensitive and they are begins with 
$ sign.

  General syntax: To declare local variables,

        $varName = value;

                  To declare "fields" (inside the class),

         access_modifier $varName; 


         Or

         access_modifier $varName = value;




    $amountofsale = 100;

    $amountOfSale = 100;

    $amount_of_sale = 100;
